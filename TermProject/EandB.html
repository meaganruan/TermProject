		I work at an Ice Cream Shop, Emack and Bolio's, located at 115 Montague Street in Brooklyn, New York. <b><em>Emack and Bolio's</em></b> originated from Boston, Massachusetts. It's a very small shop and we usually only have 1-2 people working a day. I am a supervisor, as well as a key-holder for the shop. I mostly work on the weekends because I have <a href="School.html">school</a> on the weekdays. 
	</p>

	<p>
		There are many different ice cream flavors at Emack and Bolio's. There are strange names for them too. I think Emack and Bolio's is well known for mixing literally every flavor with oreo cookies. Some weird ice cream flavors are called "<em>Space Cake</em>", "<em>Cosmic Crunch</em>", "<em>Grasshopper Pie</em>", and more. The brand is also well known for their insane marshmellow cones. The cones are made using cereals/oreo and marshmellow as adhesives to attach to the cones. We make cones daily so customers can always guarantee that what they get is fresh.

	<p>
		Many customers come and order a flavor called Toasted S'moreo; it is one of the most popular flavors at this location. <em>Toasted S'moreo</em> is a marshmellow ice cream with oreos in it. One of my personal favorite flavor of Emack and Bolio's ice cream is called <em>Stoney's Dream</em>. It is vanilla ice cream incorprated with cookie dough and fudge swirl. You can also order some ice cream flavors at <a href="ICreamery.html">Ice Creamery</a>.
